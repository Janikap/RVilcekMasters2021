#Explore the palettes on R color brewer. Try changing the color scale on a scatter plot of glucose vs. A1C




#Try adjusting the X and Y scales to be in increments of 50 for glucose, 2 for A1C in your scatter plot of A1C vs Glucose. Change the theme (background), update the X and Y labels to say "A1C level" and "Glucose level".
